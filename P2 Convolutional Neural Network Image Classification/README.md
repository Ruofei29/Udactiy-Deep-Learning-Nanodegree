# P2 Convolutional Neural Network Image Classification

## Project Overview
In this project, I classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. I preprocess the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The images need to be normalized and the labels need to be one-hot encoded. I build a convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers.
